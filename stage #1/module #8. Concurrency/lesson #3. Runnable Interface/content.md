# Thread creation by implementing the Runnable Interface

We create a new class which implements `java.lang.Runnable` interface and override `run()` method. Then we instantiate a Thread object and call `start()` method on this object.

```
class MultithreadingDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run()
    {
        try {
            // Displaying the thread that is running
            System.out.println(
                "Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getId()
                + " is running");
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            // Throwing an exception
            System.out.println("Exception is caught");
        }
    }
}
 
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int n = 8; // Number of threads
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Thread object
                = new Thread(new MultithreadingDemo());
            object.start();
        }
    }
}
```
## Thread Class vs Runnable Interface

1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like `yield()`, `interrupt()` etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
3. Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.
