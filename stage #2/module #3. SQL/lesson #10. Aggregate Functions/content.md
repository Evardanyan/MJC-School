# Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions are the functions provided in sql to perform calculations. 
As usual, they can be used with **GROUP BY**, **HAVING** clauses in **SELECT** statements or in **SELECT** clauses. 
There are different types of aggregate functions which are widely used.
Most popular aggregate functions are: **Count(), Sum(), Avg(), Min(), Max()**

## Syntax

    SELECT count(*) FROM Student;
    #Find max mark for specific student
    SELECT max(Mark) FROM Mark WHERE StudentId = 1;
    #Calculate average mark for specific student
    SELECT avg(Mark) FROM Mark WHERE StudentId = 1;
    ...
