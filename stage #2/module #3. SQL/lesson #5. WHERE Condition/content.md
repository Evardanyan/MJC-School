# WHERE condition
**WHERE** is a key word to specify a condition for an operation.
It is possible to use a set of conditions while selecting, modifying, inserting and deleting data to extract only those records that fulfill specified conditions.

## Syntax
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
```
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
