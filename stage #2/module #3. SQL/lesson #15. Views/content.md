# Views

In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
Database views are created using the **CREATE VIEW** statement. Views can be created from a single table, multiple
tables or another view.
To create a view, a user must have the appropriate system privilege according to the specific implementation.
The basic **CREATE VIEW** syntax is as follows :
```text
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2.....
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];
```
