# ORDER BY

ORDER BY is a key word which provides an opportunity to sort the data returned in a specific order.
The SQL ORDER BY clause is used to sort the data in ascending or descending order, based on one or more columns. Some
databases sort the query results in ascending order by default.  
You can use more than one column in the ORDER BY clause. Make sure whatever column you are using to sort that column
should be in the column-list.

```text
SELECT column-list 
FROM table_name 
[WHERE condition] 
[ORDER BY column1, column2, .. columnN] [ASC | DESC];
```
